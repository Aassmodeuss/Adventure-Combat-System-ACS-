## Quick Class Snapshot

- Role: Martial shapeshifter channeling animal aspects for offense, mobility, and utility.
- Alignment: Any neutral (N, NG, NE, LN, CN).
- Hit Die: d10.
- Saves/Attack: Strong Fortitude and Reflex; weaker Will. Base attack progression is martial-leaning (good for natural attacks).
- Skills: 4 + Int per level; nature and wilderness suite (see SRD for the full list).

### Core Features (shifter)

- Shifter Aspect (Su):
  - At 1st level, choose an animal "aspect". You can enter a minor form for a pool of minutes per day equal to 3 + shifter level (spent in 1-minute chunks). As you level, you gain more aspects (2nd at 5th, 3rd at 10th, 4th at 15th).
  - Minor form = small, thematic boosts and senses; Major form is accessed via Wild Shape and grants a full animal form and additional abilities defined by the aspect.
- Shifter Claws (Su):
  - Natural weapon feature that scales as you level. Depending on aspect, you can swap the default claw manifestation for alternate natural attacks (e.g., Wolf → bite). Great for full-attack sequences.
- Wild Empathy (Ex): Improve attitudes of animals; pairs well with tracking and beast-themed play.
- Defensive Instinct (Ex): Progressive defensive bonus; scales as levels advance.
- Track/Trackless Step/Woodland Stride (Ex): Wilderness navigation/tracking buffs and ignoring natural difficult terrain.
- Wild Shape (Su):
  - From 4th level, assume the Major form of an aspect (functions like beast shape II with aspect-specific overrides). Duration per day equals shifter level in hours, split in 1-hour increments.
- Later features: Shifter’s Fury (natural attack synergy), Chimeric Aspect and Greater Chimeric Aspect (mix traits from multiple aspects), A Thousand Faces/Timeless Body/Final Aspect at high levels.

## Wolf Aspect (shifter)

Theme: Hunter’s senses and takedown instincts.

- Minor Form:
  - Gain the Scent ability with 10 ft range; if you already have Scent, increase its range by 10 ft instead.
  - At 8th level, that range (or the bonus) becomes 20 ft; at 15th, 30 ft. Wind affects Scent normally (double upwind, half downwind).

- Major Form (Wild Shape):
  - Transform into a dire-wolf-like form.
  - Benefits include: base land speed 50 ft; low-light vision; Scent (30 ft baseline); a bite natural attack (1d8); and the ability to attempt a trip with that bite.
  - Higher-level improvements exist for this aspect (see SRD entry for exact scaling beyond the above).

- Shifter Claws options: When manifesting attacks via Shifter Claws, Wolf aspects can emphasize a bite sequence.

Practical notes:

- Scent + Survival makes you exceptionally good at tracking and ambush play.
- Trip on bite sets up control opportunities; combine with flanking/pack tactics from allies.

## Weretouched (Shifter Archetype)

Source: Ultimate Wilderness; SRD summary at the archetype link above.

Weretouched shifters embody lycanthropic power—able to assume animal and hybrid forms echoing a traditional lycanthrope. Choose one animal lineage for your lycanthrope aspect (e.g., wolf) and lean into that exclusively.

Key substitutions and features:

- Lycanthrope Aspect (Su):
  - You gain Shifter Aspect, but you are locked to the single chosen animal type. All future improvements refer back to that one aspect.
  - At 5th level, you gain damage reduction against non-silvered attacks equal to half your shifter level (max DR 10/silver at 20th level).
  - You are immune to contracting lycanthropy from lycanthropes (the curse of lycanthropy no longer affects you).
  - This replaces/adjusts standard Shifter Aspect progression and its later improvements.

- Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex):
  - You gain Wild Empathy and a +4 bonus with animals of your chosen lycanthrope type only (e.g., wolves for a wolf weretouched).
  - Replaces the broader Wild Empathy of the base class.

- Lycanthropic Wild Shape (Su):
  - Starting at 4th level, when you use Wild Shape, you are restricted to the chosen animal’s type for your forms.
  - Instead of only taking a full animal major form, you may also assume a hybrid form that blends your natural and animal features.
  - Hybrid form grants: +2 size bonus to Strength, +2 natural armor to AC, and you gain the natural attacks and listed abilities of the aspect’s major form.
  - You count as in your natural form for the purpose of extending Shifter Claws while hybrid, and your equipment does not meld (hybrid remains roughly the same size as your normal body).
  - This modifies standard Wild Shape.

Practical notes (Wolf Weretouched):

- Pick Wolf as your lycanthrope aspect to combine the Wolf aspect’s Scent and trip bite with hybrid-form stat bumps and DR/silver scaling.
- Hybrid form preserves gear usability while giving you natural attacks and sturdier defenses—ideal for martial builds.

## Build Pointers (Wolf-focused)

- Early levels: Ride your Minor Form Scent for scouting; open combat with Shifter Claws (bite) if you want natural-attack sequences.
- 4th+: Use Wild Shape (Wolf major form) when mobility and trip pressure matter; choose Hybrid when you need gear plus natural attacks and a tougher frontline.
- 5th+: DR/silver online for Weretouched—noticeable durability boost; keep silvered threats in mind.
- Feat synergy: Trip-supporting feats/styles, natural attack enhancers, and perception/tracking boosters all play well.

## Quick Glossary

- Aspect: The animal theme you attune to; determines Minor and Major form benefits.
- Minor Form: Minute-based, light transformation for senses/mobility/utility.
- Major Form: Full animal form via Wild Shape with aspect-specific perks.
- Scent: Special sense for detecting/tracking by smell; range and wind matter.
- DR/silver: Damage reduction bypassed by silvered weapons.
- Trip (on bite): Attempt a trip combat maneuver when you hit with your bite.
